As a forgetful UCSB student, I can pull up an app that tells me where to go and how to get there at the right time based on my schedule so that I don’t need to constantly calculate a route using Google Maps.

As a biker on campus, I can find the closest bike racks to my classes so that I can save time looking for bike racks or walking.

As a driver of a car, I can find the best parking lot to park in so that I spend less time walking back and forth from my classes.

As a student with a lot of free-time, I can select an option to fill my schedule with suggested tasks so that I don’t need to deliberate on how to fill my free-time with work/meals.
