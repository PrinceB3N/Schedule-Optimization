Our project will be some sort of Android app that creates an optimized route for the user based on their schedule. The initial iteration would be a simple route optimization by drawing routes with the shortest distance. I think that if we have enough time I would like our app to be able to account for rush hours and avoid congestion points. I imagine that the app would start off with pedestrian users but I hope that it will also be usable by bikers as well. I think a feature to find the closest bike racks would be interesting to implement.
