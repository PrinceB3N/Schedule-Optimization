Hi! I'm Ben, a 2nd year Computer Science major who is interested in cloud technology and cybersecurity. My hobbies include playing tennis, games, trumpet, and writing poems! 
I aim for this project to be a more scoped down, but versatile version of Google Maps. Students only have to input their schedule to get their directions for the day. This project will allow for new locations other than those on the schedule, so students can customize it better. Also, there will be shortcuts so that it will automatically display the shortest path from their current location to the next recorded class. In addition, all these "daily maps" can be stored and easily pulled up so students wouldn't need to reinput it again.
