Mentor: Connor Daly

Meeting Time: 1/25/2020 11:00 AM

Type of Meeting: Sprint Planning

Team: Samuel Chen, Maynic Ye, Martin Zhao, Benjamin Prince, Maria Pakinggan

Todayâ€™s meeting is to discuss the direction that we want to take the product towards
Hashing out specifics about which issues to move forward on and which one to put on the backburner
Figuring out what our minimal viable product will look like 
Create a 3-week timeline of what we want to have completed
Started on a retro using start/stop/continue template


Minimal Viable Product:
Samuel Chen - Finding the route between two hard coded locations, drawing the route and taking a picture
Maynic - Google maps accepting new nodes not coded into google
Martin - Details about internal building structure
Ben - integrate google maps api into android product, some hardcoded input and outputs one route
Maria - Agree with above


Discussion:
Maynic - keep user stories as archives/plain text, transfrom into more detailed to-do's
Maria - format kanban board based on priority

Alarm to remind of improtant events:
Ben - create notifications, next step after MVP
Maria - alarm ties into route distance
Samuel - show notifications that tell you when and where your next class is
Maynic - function that labels certain events on schedule, e.g. exams, assignments due
Martin - different colors to label different events, repeated and one time events
Importance labels to prevent users from getting spammed 

Biker on campus (finding bike racks):
Ben - difficult, need to have some way to add nodes, lot of field work and manual work
Maria -  implement if we have time at the end
Samuel - not an impactful feature, maybe at the end
Maynic - locating every rack on campus physically may take a long time 
Martin - agree with above
change from bike racks to waypoints, still an end feature goal 

Add friends to app/request access to friends schedule:
Ben - not needed, users can do it through other means, share schedules to find time blocks 
Maria - agree, shared routes can be done in google maps
Samuel - sharing routes might not be all the meaningful, but able to share and compare schedule to find open slots between riends might be interesting feature
Maynic - fun features can be added in the end, generalize to friend location feature 
Martin - access to each other schedules, manual comparison

Pull schedule from GOLD:
Ben - would be much easier than manually inputting schedule, depend on GOLD API, might be important to later development, high importance value
Maria - yes, this would be the idea, taking data directly from GOLD, we should definitely try
Samuel - ask the professor 
Maynic - more important than schedule is to verify the identity of students, only students will have the features
Martin - yes to above

Task suggestions for free time:
Ben - luxury feature, actual scheduling app feature, would be awesome, might be medium-hard to implement, seperate list of to-do's that can be slotted into your schedule (luxury)
Maria - good feature to suggest things between large gaps in your time, not a priority
Samuel - would be a greate feature but the implementation would be difficult
Maynic - pop-up feature for sidelist, "this item is on your list, do you want to do it now?", give users choice
Martin - not really viable, might be hard to extract the information we need from the person
Create a sidelist/to-do's list, items have paramenters like time constraints and priority, ask the users not choose for them

Parking lot suggestions:
Ben - find the nearest parking lot between first and last class, should we have a parking lot 
Maria - similar to bike racks problem, low priority 
Samuel - parking lots appear on the google maps 
Maynic - api might not be able to find the parking lots, most common way the user enters campus
Martin - consider parking lots might not alway be available 
luxury feature, low-mid priority

Notification to buy permit: 
Ben - low priority
Maria - low priorty
Samuel - low priority
Maynic - low priority
Martin - low priority

3-week plan
Start getting close to mvp
use fragment and viewmodel to prevent data loss
