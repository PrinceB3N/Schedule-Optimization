__**Project summary**__

This Android app helps you store events and gets the route between all the locations you need to go to in a given day! If you are a user that is new to the area, forgetful, or just want to optimize your travel, this app is perfect for you! Simply input your schedule with the addresses you need to go to in order, which will then display the routes between them in an adjustable map. The best part is that the app saves those routes, so all you have to do is click the "Get Routes" button again to display the routes of the current day!

**Known Problems**
- No options to store a subset of locations, nor advanced modification.
- Can only store one Schedule at a time.
- No way to customize these locations and routes.
- File management: Views must specify the file locations + Multiple instances of the Controller which store those file locations 
  might mean bad news if we decide to store more Schedules...
