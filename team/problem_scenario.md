Brandon Donner wakes up in the morning on Monday for the 2nd week of the Fall Quarter, and realizes he forgot the best way to get to his classes and club meetings for the day. He had this problem last time, and finds that the optimized routes he got last time were stored in the app as he opens the app. This saves him time compared to manually inputting individual start/end locations on Google Maps. He scans the routes, each numbered and color-coded, before heading off confidently to his first class.
